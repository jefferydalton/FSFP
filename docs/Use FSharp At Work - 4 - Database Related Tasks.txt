This section focuses on basics to use F# to integrate with databases.

Finished up the tutorial, but not really impressed.  I think the samples do not provide good practices for accessing data.  I can see using these techniques to do some quick n dirty prototyping, but I wonder if this is really the right way to work with domain persistance.  There were a lot of rough edges in the sample code.  I had to jump back and forth between the actual source in github and the sampes presented in online article.  There was some mismatches and not enough effort was put into explaining what was going on.  So if I had to rate this course I would give it a 2 outta 5 stars.
